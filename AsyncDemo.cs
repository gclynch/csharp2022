// demo of async and await C# 5
// async: an asynchronous method which runs synchronously until first await at which point it suspends
// and returns to its caller to be continued, awaited task will complete later

			// out of things to do now await result from t

            int slept = await t;                                // suspend and return to caller if not finished

            // or
            // int slept = await SleepAsync();					

            // result in slept now available
            Console.WriteLine("RunAsync: Slept for " + slept + " milliseconds");

            // no return value
        }

        // entry point
        static void Main()
        {
            Task t = RunAsync();
            t.Wait();                                           // block, not the same as an await, fine since no UI
            // await means method being called must return Task or Task<T>
        }
    }
}

// await takes a single argument - an "awaitable" i.e. an asynchronous operation (method, lambda, anonymous method)
// await will check if the awaitable is finished, if so just continue on executing the code after the await (act synchronously)
// if not finished then it tells the awaitable to run the rest of the method when it finishes and then return (i.e. act asynchronously)
// the awaitable when finished will run the rest of the async method
// awaitable types are Task and Task<T>
// an async method can have a Task, Task<T> or void return type (void is not awaitable)
// a method does not have to be async to be awaited, but an await in a method means it must be async

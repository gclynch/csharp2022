a function should do one thing
maybe 10 lines of code max
keep the number of arguments low (e.g. max 3) e.g 5! = 120, pass in objects
avoid boolean arguments, break the function into 2, one for true one for false
avoid output parameters, use return types
name the function appropriately
it should read like nice prose
it should be understandable
fix it up to make it clean after you get it to work
don't be rude to the reader, they should be able to understand quickly the purpose of a function early
without having to read the whole thing
don't jump around with respect to levels of abstraction
indentation - 2 or 3 levels max
keep the number of WFTs low, avoid surprises
avoid switch e.g. on shape type, use polymorphism
avoid side effects in functions
avoid side effects regarding paired operations e.g. open/close a file
functions that return void change the state of the system otherwise they are not worth calling
functions that return a value should have no side effect (safe)
use exceptions, not error codes
dont repeat yourself (it is sloppy)
